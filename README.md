This repository contains code examples and explanations that I'm using to teach absolute beginners.

The official documentation at MSDN (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/)
provides a much better overview of the language.

The code shown here is intended only for beginners, not advanced programmers.

If you already know how to program, you're much better off reading the official documentation and programming guide.
