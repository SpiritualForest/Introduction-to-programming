In this lesson we talked about writing our own methods,
using loops to execute code repeatedly,
conditionals (if statement),
and we introduced the use of primitive arrays and generic lists.

A small sorting algorithm, which demonstrates the use of all the concepts
presented in the lesson, can be found here: https://gist.github.com/SpiritualForest/57391deddab08b98a09572ac14da7872
