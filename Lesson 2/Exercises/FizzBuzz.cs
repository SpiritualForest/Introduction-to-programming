/* FizzBuzz is a well known and simple programming exercise.
 * Display all numbers from 1 to n.
 * For every number that is divisible by 3, you write "Fizz" instead of the number.
 * For every number that is divisible by 5, you write "Buzz" instead of it.
 * For every number is that is divisible by both 3 AND 5, you write "FizzBuzz" instead of it.
 * Every other number which doesn't fit any of these criteria gets displayed normally.
 * For example: 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz...
 *
 * Use the modulus operator (%) to check if a number is divisible by another number. */
